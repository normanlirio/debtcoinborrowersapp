       Since Debtcoin is just a newly-established company and we are still in the stage of enhancing the system, we limit the registered applicants. And sadly, the approved loan applicants for private sector had exceeded the quantity that we set. Thus, for now, we only accept loan applicants from public sector. We hope for your understanding.
\n\n
If you are a government employee and wanted to avail a loan, just message us thru our mobile app and we will open a slot for you to continue registering.
